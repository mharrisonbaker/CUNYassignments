##The problem is found on page 72

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Define coefficient matrix 
```{r define}
A = matrix(c(-1, 5, 0, 0, -2, 5, 5, 2, -3, -1, 3, 1, 7, 6, 5, 1), nrow = 4, ncol = 4, byrow=TRUE)

A

det(A)

# B = matrix(c(-8, 9, 3, 30), nrow = 4, ncol = 1, byrow = TRUE)
# 
# B
```

##find determinant of coefficient matrix 
```{r det}
det(A)
```

The matrix is nonsingular because it determinant is not 0.  It should invertible.

```{r inverse}
A.i=solve(A)
A.i
```
Indeed it is invertible!
