This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#import data file into dataframe
```{r}
flightdf = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mharrisonbaker/CUNYassignments/master/assignment5/flightontime.csv")
flightdf %>% gather(city, delay, Los.Angeles:Seattle)
```

#filter for delayed flights
```{r}
flightdf %>% filter(Schedule=="delayed") %>% arrange(Airline) -> flightdelaysdf
kable(flightdelaysdf) %>% kable_styling()
```

#See how many flights each airline completes on time and delayed to each city.  Am West has more flights total, mostly to Phoenix.
```{r}
flightdf%>%mutate(TotalFlights = rowSums(.[3:7])) -> flightdf
kable(flightdf) %>% kable_styling()
```


##calculate on time percentage for each airline by city
```{r}
#on time rate AK
flightdf %>% filter(Airline=="ALASKA") %>% arrange(Airline) -> flightdelaysdfAK
AKotr <- flightdelaysdfAK[1,3:7]/(flightdelaysdfAK[1,3:7]+flightdelaysdfAK[2,3:7])

#on time rate AW
flightdf %>% filter(Airline=="AM WEST") %>% arrange(Airline) -> flightdelaysdfAW
AWotr <- flightdelaysdfAW[1,3:7]/(flightdelaysdfAW[1,3:7]+flightdelaysdfAW[2,3:7])

#on time percentage, here the table is made long
otr<-rbind(AKotr, AWotr)
otr$Airline<-c("ALASKA", "AM WEST")
otr %>% gather(city, OnTimePercentage, Los.Angeles:Seattle) %>% arrange(OnTimePercentage) -> otr
kable(otr) %>% kable_styling()
```

##Am West is doing the worst of all data points in San Fran (foggy).  Phoenix is the best city for on time arrivals (nice weather). Alaksa Airlines has a better on time percentage in every city.

```{r}

```{r}
#calculation for histograms below
longdelays<-flightdelaysdf %>% gather(city, delay, Los.Angeles:Seattle)
```


##I made these histograms but they shouldn't really be compared by airline, as each airline flies a different total amount of flights and these don't account for total amount of flights per city.  I left them in but would not consider them effective for comparative analysis.

## histogram of Alaska Airways delays
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#histogram of ak delays(good)
AKdelay <- longdelays %>% filter(Airline=="ALASKA")
AKhist<-hist(AKdelay$delay, main = "Histogram of Alaska Airlines Delays", xlab = "Minutes", ylab = "# in bin")
AKhist
```

## histogram of American West Airlines delays
```{r, echo=FALSE}
#histogram of aw delays (good)
AWdelay <- longdelays %>% filter(Airline=="AM WEST")
AWhist<-hist(AWdelay$delay, main ="Histogram of American West Airlines Delays", xlab = "Minutes", ylab = "# in bin")
AWhist
```


##
```{r}
#delay stats per airline(good)
AKdelay2 <- longdelays %>% filter(Airline=="ALASKA") %>% summarise(max(delay), min(delay), mean(delay), sd(delay), median(delay), IQR(delay))
AWdelay2 <- longdelays %>% filter(Airline=="AM WEST") %>% summarise(max(delay), min(delay), mean(delay), sd(delay), median(delay), IQR(delay))
AKdelay2
AWdelay2
delaystatsdf <-rbind(AKdelay2, AWdelay2)
airnames <- c("ALAKSA", "AM WEST")
delaystatsdf$names<-airnames
```

Here is a table of relevant delay stats by airline.  Alaska is superior in all categories.
```{r}
#max, min, mean etc per city
kable(delaystatsdf[,c("names", "mean(delay)",  "median(delay)", "max(delay)", "min(delay)")]) %>% kable_styling()
```
